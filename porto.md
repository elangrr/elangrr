`Hi I'm Indonode.dev (Indonode#5255) I'm from Indonesia, I'm an experienced web3 enthusiast, contributor, moderator, ambassador and PoS/PoW validator, and cosmos lover.

An insight of me - Deep knowledge and passion of Web3, Cosmos Ecosystem and decentralization. 2+ years experience in the Blockchain strong knowledge about cosmos and validator field. L1/L2 blockchains and yield farming strategies. I thrive on daily ingestion of new developments in web3, including DeFi, community engagement and problem solving. Contributor, detail-oriented with a curious mind. What keeps me engaged is the fact that I learn something new every single day.

My main vision and goal is to help new people and make their experience with blockchain a little bit easier, that's why I write guides in my github Indonode.dev, Most of it is in English, but I also actively support Indonesian languages. I'm creating or supporting English/Indonesian chats as CO-Founder & Support in NodeX Capital Discord Community where I'm helping people with the same interest.

Overall, I'm very excited and passionate about it. I pay close attention to each of my validators, I support them both with my time, 24 hours a day, Maintaining a healthy validator is one of my priority.
